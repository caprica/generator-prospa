This project was automatically generated by [<%= generatorName %>](<%= generatorUrl%>).

This is a fully working Single Page Application with properly configured client *and* server-side routing.

Full Compile and Build
---

In a command-window, type:

```
mvn clean install
```

Running the Server
---

In a command-window, type:

```
<%- include(`run-${framework}.md`); -%>
```

In a web-browser, go to:

```
http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>
```

Routing
---

Fully working client *and* server-side routing is implemented.

All server-side routes like those below will be properly routed to the client for client-side routing:

```
http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>
http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>/index.html
http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>/users
http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>/users/{username}
http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>/this/route/does/not/exist
```

JSON API
---

Web-services are provided at the "/api" path:

```
GET http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>/api/users
GET http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>/api/users/{username}
GET http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>/api/version
```

Any attempt to access a non-existing API path will result in a standard "HTTP 400 Bad Request" response.

Front-end Application
---

[PENDING]

Web-Services API Proxy
---

When the application is running in development mode, web-service API requests can be proxied to a development server:

<%- include(`proxy-${frontEnd}.md`); -%>
